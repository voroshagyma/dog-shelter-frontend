# Practicing Angular - Dog Shelter front end

This is a very simple Angular project I use to practice Angular.

## What the user can do
1. list the dogs
2. search the dogs by name, age and breed
3. paginate the list of dogs by 20
4. login: {username: 'john', password: 'changeme'}
5. add dog if logged in
6. edit dog if logged in
7. delete dog if logged in
8. logout

## Techniques used
1. Bootstrap
2. routing
3. route guards
4. reactive forms
5. form validation
6. jwt
7. local auth
8. separate modules for different features
9. reusable components
10. services

## TODO
1. better understanding of observables
2. store jwt in local storage
3. better UI
4. CRUD for users
5. unit testing
